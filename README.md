The objective of this project is the creation of an application for managing a
catalog of office supplies through a database of
SQLite data using Microsoft Visual Studio .

Integrate a " csv " file to feed the database.
- Allow database management via clear and explicit screens.
- Allow the export of all the data in a "csv" file to the same
format than the "csv" file provided for the first application.
